These files are [http://searle.hostei.com/grant/Multicomp/index.html Grant Searle's Multicomp] Retro-Computer targeted for the UK101. Grant's project re-creates late 1970's and early 1980's era vintage computers using an inexpensive Altera Cyclone II EP2 FPGA card. The various builds that make up different vintage retro-computers are in each of the folders. This page ports that implementation to a commercial board which has hardware resources built into the card. This particular computer was known as the BBC Computer (the beeb by fans) and in the US as the Ohio Scientific SuperBoard II or C1P.

The card used is a commercial product [http://land-boards.com/blwiki/index.php?title=Cyclone_IV_FPGA_EP4CE6E22C8N_Development_Board_USB_V2 described here].

== Ownership ==

* Some of these files such as FPGA designs and software libraries were created by others.
** There may be newer versions of these libraries "out there".
** Some libraries even have the same names but don't work the same.
* Many of these files were created by me based on the work of others.

=== Warning ===

* Use at your own risk.
** If you brick your part or it melt to a puddle, it's on you not me.
