== land-boards RETRO-EP4 FPGA Retro-Computer Board ==

* Untested configurations are marked as Work-In-Progress (WIP) below.

* These are the VHDL files for our [http://land-boards.com/blwiki/index.php?title=RETRO-EP4CE6 RETRO-EP4 board].
** This card presents a hardware implementation of [http://searle.hostei.com/grant/Multicomp/index.html Grant Searle's Multicomp] Retro-Computer.
** Grant's projects re-create late 1970's and early 1980's era vintage computers using inexpensive FPGA cards.
* Our [http://land-boards.com/blwiki/index.php?title=RetroComputing RetroComputing Wiki page is here].

== RETRO-EP4 Features ==

* Combines the features of the Land Boards [http://land-boards.com/blwiki/index.php?title=EP2C5-DB EP2C5-DB] and [http://land-boards.com/blwiki/index.php?title=BASE-EP4CE6 BASE-EP4CE6] boards
* Geared towards Retro-Computing
** Grant Searle's Multicomp project as an example
** Uses WaveShare [https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/CoreEP4CE6 CoreEP4CE6] EP4CE6E22C8N FPGA Board as the processing element
*** EP4CE15E22C8N and EP4CE22E22C8N are pin compatible parts but as far as I can see there's no card available from WaveShare with either FPGA

* Adds 512 KB of fast SRAM
** Access from 8-bit microprocessors by using a banking/mapping register inside the FPGA
* I/O Connectivity
** PS/2 keyboard connector
** VGA connector
** FTDI socket
** VGA, PS/2, andSerial I/O connections on a single edge
* 5V power connector (on rear edge)
* SD Card slot
** SD card mounts from rear bottom of the board
* Same form factor as the EP2C5-DB and BASE-EP4CE6

== Land Boards - Other FPGA Projects ==

These different folders reflect the hardware that we have got Multicomp running on. Some of these designs are Land Boards and others are based on commercial products.

* [http://land-boards.com/blwiki/index.php?title=EP2C5-DB Land Boards EP2C5-DB FPGA Retro-Computer card]
** Duplicates Grant's design down to the pin maps
* [http://land-boards.com/blwiki/index.php?title=BASE-EP4CE6 Land Boards BASE-EP4CE6 card] is a breakout board that cables up to the [http://land-boards.com/blwiki/index.php?title=EP2C5-DB Land Boards EP2C5-DB card]
** Adds extra logic and RAM resources beyond the EP2C5 FPGA
*** Can do up to 16K of Internal SRAM
** [http://land-boards.com/blwiki/index.php?title=Retro-Computer_Map_EP2_to_EP4_card Wiring is here]
* [http://land-boards.com/blwiki/index.php?title=Cyclone_IV_FPGA_EP4CE6E22C8N_Development_Board_USB_V2 Purchased EP4 FPGA card]
** Includes VGA, PS/2 and USB-Serial converter
** Other I/O is serious limitation but a 16K retro machine without SD Card storage can easily be built

== Ownership ==

* Some of these files such as FPGA designs and software libraries were created by others.
** There may be newer versions of these libraries "out there".
** Some libraries even have the same names but don't work the same.
* Many of these files were created by me based on the work of others.

=== Warning ===

* Use at your own risk.
** If you brick your part or it melt to a puddle, it's on you not me.
