== Blink LED on the RETRO-EP4 FPGA Retro-Computer Board ==

* This code blinks the four LEDs on the EP4CE6 FPGA board.
* Running this code verifies that the power is connected from the [http://land-boards.com/blwiki/index.php?title=RETRO-EP4CE6 RETRO-EP4 board] to the [http://land-boards.com/blwiki/index.php?title=EP4CE6E22C8N_FPGA_Board EP4CE6E22C8N FPGA Board].
* Our [http://land-boards.com/blwiki/index.php?title=RetroComputing RetroComputing Wiki page is here].

== Ownership ==

* Some of these files such as FPGA designs and software libraries were created by others.
** There may be newer versions of these libraries "out there".
** Some libraries even have the same names but don't work the same.
* Many of these files were created by me based on the work of others.

=== Warning ===

* Use at your own risk.
** If you brick your part or it melt to a puddle, it's on you not me.
